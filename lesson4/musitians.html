    <h1>Michael Joseph Jackson</h1>
<p id="michael">
    <strong>Biography</strong></br>Michael Joseph Jackson was born on August 29, 1958, in Gary, Indiana. 
    He was the eighth of 10 children born to Joseph Jackson, a crane operator, 
    and Katherine Jackson, a homemaker and a devout Jehovah’s Witness. Both of Jackson’s 
    parents previously had musical aspirations themselves: Katherine played clarinet and 
    piano and had aspired to be a country singer, while Joseph was a guitarist who performed 
    in local R&B bands. They encouraged their children to pursue musical ambitions, 
    and Jackson’s career in music began at the age of 5 under his father’s encouragement. 
    Almost all of Jackson’s siblings made marks in the music industry, including Rebbie, Jackie, 
    Tito, Jermaine, La Toya, Marlon, Randy, and Janet Jackson. (His brother Brandon, Marlon’s twin, 
    died shortly after birth.) Joseph pushed his children hard to succeed, making them rehearse 
    five hours a day after school, and was reportedly known to become violent with them. 
    He was said to beat them with a belt buckle or electric kettle cord and to order them to break 
    a branch off a tree if they got a dance step wrong so he could hit them with it.

<p id="michael">
    <strong>Biography</strong></br>Franks grew up in southern California with his father Jerry,
    his mother Betty, and two younger sisters. Although no one in his family was a musician,
     his parents loved swing music, and his early influences included Peggy Lee, Nat King Cole,
    George Gershwin, Irving Berlin, and Johnny Mercer. At age 14 Franks bought his first guitar,
     a Japanese Marco Polo for $29.95 with six private lessons included; those lessons were the
     only music education that he received.
